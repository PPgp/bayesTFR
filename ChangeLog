4.0-4/5 (02/07/2014) [CRAN]
-------
Added an option for switching the method for finding the beginning of phase II (tau_c)

4.0-0 (5/23/2013) [CRAN]
-----
WPP data removed and put in separate packages (wpp2008, wpp2010). The package is now dependent on those.
	
Incorporating Bailey Fosdick's method (and code) for joint projections between countires into the tfr.predict function 
(argument use.correlation). Many internal changes as a result of that.

Patrick Gerland's code used for:
	changing the projection in tfr.map function to the Robinson world projections,
	fixing a few UN codes (there is some mismatch in the rworldmaps codes and what the UN is using)
	
tfr.trajectories.plot got an argument mark.estimation.points for marking points in phase II and III.

3.0-9 (4/19/2013)
-----
minor internal changes in adjusting median

3.0-8 (4/5/2013) [CRAN]
-----
.find.package replaced by find.package.

Two columns (indicatorID and sexID) added to the projection summary file.

Bug in tfr.median.adjust fixed.

Fixed an issue when Phase III starts before 1950.

3.0-2/3 (2/28/2013)

Argument 'verbose.iter' added to run.tfr.mcmc.

Argument 'data.args' added to tfr.map.

1.5-1 (03/29/2012)
-----
Example data reduced from three chains of 50 iterations each to two chains of 30 iterations each in order to make the package smaller.

Rename coda.mcmc.list to coda.list.mcmc in order not to intervene with the S3 method coda.mcmc.

Function tfr.GoF.dl added to compute goodness of fit.

Argument 'predictive.distr' addedto the DLcurve.plot function to plot the double logistic curves including the error term.

1.5-0 (11/17/2011)
-----
Performance improved in two ways:
1. MCMCs are converted to environments (instead of being lists), so that they are not copied every time.
2. A few functions implemented in C.

1.4-2 (10/13/2011)
-----
Minor changes in get.prediction.summary.data.

Internal changes in the function for plotting world maps.

New function called get.countries.table added.

1.4-1 (07/15/2011)
-----   
Citation and reference to a JSS	article	added.
	
1.4-0 (05/06/2011)
-----
Official UN WPP 2010 data added to the package and the default for argument wpp.year set to 2010. 

The rho and sigmaAR1 arguments of the tfr.predict function replaced by estimates based on the new data.

Removed argument html.file from the function tfr.map.gvis, since the new version of the googleVis
package (0.2.4) now creates html files automatically.

Added item 'iter.incr' to the 'auto.conf' argument in run.tfr.mcmc, to distinguish between 
the length of the initial simulation and the incrementals in case it did not converge.

1.3-1 (03/15/2011)
-----
Test data and locations from WPP 2010 removed.

1.3-0 (03/11/2011)
-----

1.2-6 (02/24/2011)
-----
Bugs in tfr.median.adjustDL and tfr.predict.extra fixed.

1.2-5 (02/21/2011)
-----
Function tfr.median.adjustDL renamed to tfr.median.adjust. Added an argument forceAR1 for controlling
if countries enter Phase III in the first projection period.

In tfr.trajectories.plot added an argument adjusted.only. If FALSE, both the unadjusted and
adjusted medians are plotted.

In write.projection.summary added an argument adjusted. If TRUE, the summary is based on adjusted
projections. File names have the suffix '_adjusted'. 

New function for TFR maps, called tfr.map.gvis. Package googleVis added to suggested packages.

1.2-4 (02/17/2011)
-----
Median adjustment of the DL predictions implemented (function tfr.median.adjustDL)

1.2-3 (02/16/2011)
-----
In get.ar1.parameters: rounding removed; parameters are estimated only on countries that are included
in the estimation of the world parameters.

Bug in DLcurve.plot fixed causing plotting one line less than nr.curves.

1.2-2 (02/16/2011)
-----
Condition for the AR1 process introduced not to fall below 0.5 (UN request).   

Test data removed.

m1<-run.tfr.mcmc(...) and m2<-get.tfr.mcmc(...) now return results that pass the test identical(m1,m2).

Internal changes to allow bayesLife reusing package functionality.

1.1-0 (10/14/2010)
-----
Functions tfr.median.set and tfr.median.shift for modifying the projection medians 
(request of the UN population division).

The UN2008.txt file replaced by one whith TFRs on 4 decimal places (provided by the UN). 
Projection summary files are outputted also with 4 decimals.

The projection_summary.csv contains also the historical data.

New function: get.tfr.trajectories

1.0-0 (10/04/2010)
-----
Convergence diagnostics functions re-designed.
	
The 'auto' functionality implemented (when iter='auto' in run.tfr.mcmc and continue.tfr.mcmc).

New defaults for nr.chains (3) and iter (62000) in run.tfr.mcmc.

0.8-0 (09/07/2010)
-----
Parameter 'delta' removed from the set of parameters that were analyzed on transfored scale.

Function tfr.diagnose rewrote.

0.7-0 (05/17/2010)
-----
Reverting the change from version 0.5-0: Parameter traces stored again in plain ASCII, 
due to a bug in R 2.11.0 (function gzfile does not work with the append mode) 
[This change is not reflected in the documentation yet.]

A few internal changes that make some functions more general.

0.6-2 (05/05/2010)
-----
Functions get.parameter.names and get.parameter.names.cs renamed to tfr.parameter.names and
tfr.parameter.names.cs, respectively.

New functions for plotting parameter density implemented, called tfr.pardensity.plot and
tfr.pardensity.plot.cs.

-----
Bug in the fucntion tfr.predict.extra fixed.

Arguments of the functions get.parameter.names and get.parameter.names.cs changed.

Summary function for predictions got an extra argument 'compact' to allow for a smaller table.

0.6-0 (03/29/2010)
-----
Default value for MCMC length changed to 102,000.

New function for checking MCMC convergence: tfr.diagnose

New class for convergence objects: bayesTFR.convergence, its getter and summary functions implemented.

Prediction procedure now stores thinned traces (in predictions/thinned.mcmc) that correspond exactly 
to the parameter samples used for making the trajectories. Various functions can now use those traces 
instead of the unthinned ones in order to speed things up. 

Loading MCMC traces made more memory efficient. 

In prediction: checking if prediction directory already exists moved to the beginning of the function 
(before traces are loaded, since that can take lots of time).


0.5-0 (03/01/2010)
-----
Prediction directory is not dependent on the end year anymore. It is stored into a subdirectory called
'predictions'. An argument 'replace.output' added to the tfr.predict function which controls if new 
predictions should overwrite the old ones. 

Parameter traces are now stored in a compressed format (with ending .gz).

Function for generating maps for all projections added (called tfr.map.all).

Function for displaying world maps added, called tfr.map. This functionality is dependent on the R packages
rworldmap and fields which were added to the 'suggested packages'.

All delta variables renamed to Triangle. sigma variables renamed to delta. This change was done in order 
to be consistent with the notation in the reference paper. It affects names of output files - therefore 
any existing simulations must be re-run.

Added shape parameter for the prior Gamma distribution of sigma4.

0.4-5 (02/18/2010)
-----
A bug fixed that caused country names from a user-specified TFR file to be NAs.

0.4-4 (02/03/2010)
-----
my.tfr.file (passed to run.tfr.mcmc) can now contain the column 'include_code' with the following meaning: 
-1: do not overwrite the include_code in the location file
0: ignore
1: include in projections but not estimation
2: include in estimation and projections
Except of the case of -1, these values overwrite the include_code in the location file. This option allows 
to include and exclude countries from the  estimation without having to recompile the package.

Non-standard quantiles were computed only on the set of displayed trajectories. Now they are computed on at least
2000 trajectories or all, if the total number of trajectories is less than 2000.

0.4-3 (01/24/2010)
-----
All input files were converted from semicolon-separated files to tab-separated files. This impacts also 
the my.tfr.file format, which should be also tab-separated.

Documentation: Patrick's suggestions and corrections put in. Better explanation of the my.tfr.file argument.

A few test functions added into the 'test' directory (will be called automatically by the R checking procedure).

Y-scaling bug (in tfr.trajectories.plot) fixed.

A bug causing country names from my.tfr.file being NAs fixed.

0.4-2 (01/16/2010)
-----
Country-specific prediction enabled (function tfr.predict.extra).

Code cleaned-up after Leontine's review.

Information added to the summary functions for both, mcmc and prediction.

Documentation updated from 0.3-2 version.

By default, the sigmaAR1 parameter is kept constant for all AR(1) projections. The argument allows to enter
a series of sigmas for the series of projections. Thus, it does not need to be kept constant, if desired. 
This change allowed to remove the 'sigma.end' argument.

0.4-0 (01/02/2010)
-----
Ability of running MCMC and predictions for extra countries or regions (not included in the estimation) implemented.
This feature required significant refactoring of the code. New function: run.tfr.mcmc.extra.

AR(1) parameters can be computed on the fly.

Prediction is now made also for countries that have not start fertility transition at the last observation point.

0.3-2 (12/15/2009)
-----
Bug in the prediction function fixed that caused the first imputed value to be the same as the last observed value.

Argument U.width added to the run function.

0.3-1 (12/14/2009)
-----
Allowing argument my.tfr.file in run.tfr.mcmc. It is a file which can include user-specified TFRs for one or more 
countries. Entries in tfr_matrix corresponding to those countries are replaced by the data in this file. It can also
contain countries not included in the UN2008 file. In such a case, it is added to the tfr_matrix. A template file 
is included in the 'data' directory (my_tfr_template.csv).

Imputed data (when using the 'last.observed' feature) are now clearly marked in the TFR trajectories graphs.

The structure of the proposal_cov_gammas_cii data set changed. A function for computing such object added.

const_sd_dummie_Tc moved from mcmc object to mcmc$meta.

alpha0 parameter changed to alpha0.p and has now three values instead of one.

Need for data sets Uw_c and DLpar_ini eliminated. 

lambda_c is now computed on the fly, therefore the data set lambda_c removed.

Projection years in the summary function for a prediction changed to middle years of intervals.

Additional output from tfr.raftery.diag.

Minor change in coda.mcmc reflecting the thinning interval.

0.2-4 (12/08/2009)
-----
Enabling different last years of observed data. The missing data are imputed using the medians from the BHM procedure. 
The functionality can be switched on by adding a column 'last.observed' to UN2008.csv. This column is contained 
in UN2008_with_last_obs.csv (in bayesTFR/data), so renaming that file to UN2008.csv would do the job 
(note that the set of countries in UN2008_with_last_obs.csv is not identical to UN2008.csv). 

The asymptotic sd in the AR(1) model is now set to 0.203 after a max of 4 projection periods.

0.2-3 (11/30/2009)
-----
Bug in the function get.thinned.index fixed, which caused tfr.predict to fail for some values of the argument nr.traj.

0.2-2 (11/10/2009)
-----
The convert.tfr.trajectories function also stores the trajectories in a UN-specific 'transposed' format.
	
Function convert.trajectories renamed to convert.tfr.trajectories.
	
Removed a condition that the minimum of tfr_matrix must be >=1 (which excluded Macao and Hong Kong)
	
Bug fixes in tfr.gelman.diag and tfr.raftery.diag functions.

Trajectories now cannot result in NA values - if an implausible value is generated, it is re-sampled.
	
Prediction function tfr.predict accepts argument nr.traj which gives number of trajectories to be generated.
	
0.2-1
-----
All modifications due to the following changes in the method:

1. Delta_c4 is estimated for each country
2. Observed turnaround periods (shifts beteen DL and AR(1)) are given by lambda (the midpoint if there are two increases
   below 2, see report). (Note that this is now put into the R_package as a data file, but we'll probably write code 
   to estimate it within the package.)
3. Predicted turnaround point is after the first increase after TFR gets below delta_c4
4. Distortion in start year tau has a distribution with diffferent sd than in the other years, and non-zero mean.
5. AR(1) parameters for prediction have been re-restimated based on new definition of turnaround point

0.1-6
-----
Changes in function raftery.tfr.diag (additional output).
	
Argument mcmc.set in DLcurve.plot.all renamed to mcmc.list.

Function for writing out prediction summary in a UN-specific format implemented (write.projection.summary).
	
Parameters on which transformation is performed renamed to alphat, deltat, gammat. Modifications in functions 
that deal with them. Now they are handled in the same way as their not transformed counterparts.

0.1-5
-----

Setting RNG seed enabled.
	
Functions for exporting trajectories from binary format to UN-specific ascii format. 
Arguments to control the number of such trajectories added.
	
Modifications for enabling different last years of observed data (not finished yet).
	
Legend's color in trajectories plot fixed.

More documentation.

Bug in function country.names fixed.
	
0.1-4
-----
More documentaiton.	
	
For better disk usage, the variables 'eps_Tc', 'const_sd_dummie_Tc', and 'add_to_sd_Tc' are not stored into disk, 
since they can be recomputed when needed.

An option to plot/tabulate the half-child variant added.
	
Functions for plotting TFR trajectories and DL curves for ALL countries written (tfr.trajectories.plot.all, DLcurve.plot.all).

Plotting functions for trajectories and DL curve accept additional graphical parameters.
	
Files with country-specific parameters and trajectories have now the country code as postfix, instead of country index.
